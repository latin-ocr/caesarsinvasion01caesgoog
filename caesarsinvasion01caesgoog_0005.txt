PREFAOE.

*CAESAR'S ‘ Invasion of Britain’ is intended as a first
Translation Book. The text, which has been taken
from Books IV. and V. of the Gallic War, has been
simplified as much as possible3 the various construc-
tions being introduced gradually to the learner’s
notice. On each construction will be found one or
more exercises and an explanation or rule.

An English vocabulary has been added at the
request of the Publishers, and the obJection raised to
such a vocabulary in the Introduction to the Eutropius
has been overcome by giving a reference to the chap-
ter or vocabulary where the word occurs instead of
giving the Latin word itself.
