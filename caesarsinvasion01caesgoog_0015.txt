IN TROD UOTION. xv

Caesar “ rather showed Britain to posterity , than
handed it down to them as a conquest. ’' It was not
until nearly a hundred years later, in the reign of the
Emperor Claudius (A.D. 43 and 44), that any part of
Britain was annexed to the Roman empire.

(The localities mentioned above are disputed by
various writers ; many places contend for the honour
of Gaesar's landing-plaee, but the views of Mr. Georgo
Long on such matters have been adopted, and to him

the editors are indebted for help in other parts of the
book.)
